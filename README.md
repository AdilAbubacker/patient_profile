## 🚀 About Me

Full Stack Developer by day, problem-solving addict by night. I architect scalable systems that make both users and developers smile. With a foundation built on 550+ LeetCode problems and a passion for clean, efficient code, I transform complex challenges into elegant solutions.

When I'm not refactoring 10,000-line codebases into neat 200-line components, you might find me orchestrating microservices like a tech conductor or optimizing database queries for that extra millisecond of performance.

## 💻 Tech Arsenal

```
⚡ Frontend: React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
🛠️ Backend: Django, DRF, Celery, Django Channels, WebSockets, REST API, JWT
🏗️ Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EKS, EC2, EFS, S3)
📊 Data: PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis
🔄 Microservices: Apache Kafka
🔤 Languages: Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS
```

## 🏆 Highlights

- Led development of a financial analysis platform, slashing API load by 85%
- Engineered a microservices architecture with 10+ independently scalable services
- Built concurrency-safe booking systems with transactional locking
- Implemented real-time notification systems with WebSockets
- Containerized applications with Docker & deployed on Kubernetes
